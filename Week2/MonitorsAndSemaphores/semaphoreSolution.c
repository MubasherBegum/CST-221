@Program: CST â€“ 221 Monitors and Semaphores -Using Semaphores
@Author: Mubasher Mehnaz Begum
@Date:   June 14, 2020

@About: Define a simple scenario where Semaphores can be used

@Solution: Following is a solution to a senario where in multiple threads access make a credit card transaction.
